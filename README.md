# DNS Summarize Tool

## Getting Started
If you want to install the dependencies in a virtual environment, create and activate that environment first.
```
git clone https://github.com/y9k8i/DNS-summarize-tool.git
cd DNS-summarize-tool
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
garden install matplotlib
```
If you are running on Windows, add `-X utf8` command line option or set the `PYTHONUTF8=1` environment variable.
